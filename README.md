# GlowingText-WindowsTerminalShader
minimal glowing text for windows terminal

With windows terminal installed, open the JSON file containing your settings and add this line to your chosen profile.
I put mine under my defaults here

 "profiles": 
    {
        "defaults": 
        {
        
        
And I add this key value pair

  "experimental.pixelShaderPath": "{PATH}//Retro.hlsl",
  
And there you go
